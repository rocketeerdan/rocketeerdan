<p align="center">If you're seeing this, you're probably from ponytown, hello!!! :D</p>
<p align="center">I'm Dan!! Your local autistic guy who plays a pony game instead of getting a job! Feel free to interact, I don't mind!!</p>
<p align="center">I'm either in the OSC area of the safe server or just a general area of the 18+ server!</p>
<p align="center">I've watched a LOT of Object Shows, more likely than not I'll recognize the show your pony is from!</p>
<p align="center">My favorite Object Shows are Paper Puppets Take 2 and Love Of The S*n! (I also really like the comic Objectified!!)</p>

<p align="center"><b>GAME INFO STUFF!!</b></p>
<p align="center">I'm an <b>adult</b>, please be aware of that when talking to me! (I can talk/have conversations with younger people but I'm not looking to be friends with anyone under 16!)</p>
<p align="center">Please whisper to interact!! I'm offtab a lot (+ I get distracted easily!)</p>
<p align="center">C+H is okay, Booping is okay, pretty much everything is okay!! No need to ask :] </p>
<p align="center">I'm not a system! Consider all my ponies to be merely cosplay!</p>
<p align="center">I don't RP! Talk to me as my own person and not as the character I'm playing as please!!</p>
